Python MySQL Delete From By
Delete Record
You can delete records from an existing table by using the "DELETE FROM" statement:

Example
Delete any record where the address is "Mountain 21":

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = 'Mountain 21'"

mycursor.execute(sql)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) deleted")
Important!: Notice the statement: mydb.commit(). It is required to make the changes, otherwise no changes are made to the table.

Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE syntax: The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be deleted!

Prevent SQL Injection
It is considered a good practice to escape the values of any query, also in delete statements.

This is to prevent SQL injections, which is a common web hacking technique to destroy or misuse your database.

The mysql.connector module uses the placeholder %s to escape values in the delete statement:

Example
Escape values by using the placeholder %s method:

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = %s"
adr = ("Yellow Garden 2", )

mycursor.execute(sql, adr)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) deleted")

Python MySQL Drop Table
Delete a Table
You can delete an existing table by using the "DROP TABLE" statement:

Example
Delete the table "customers":

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DROP TABLE customers"

mycursor.execute(sql)
Drop Only if Exist
If the the table you want to delete is already deleted, or for any other reason does not exist, you can use the IF EXISTS keyword to avoid getting an error.

Example
Delete the table "customers" if it exists:

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="yourusername",
  passwd="yourpassword",
  database="mydatabase"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers"

mycursor.execute(sql)
